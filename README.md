# 🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression in R

This project analyzes the key factors influencing life expectancy across countries and regions using a publicly available dataset compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations. The applied domain is **public health and global development**, and the focus is on developing a **multiple linear regression model** to uncover relationships between life expectancy and health, economic, and social indicators.
